    "* Simple approach of using TF-IDF to sequentially filter the corpus of documents + using a pre-trained language model finetuned on Q&A tasks to highlight answers from the shortlisted paragraphs allowed us to answer some of the key questions with reasonable accuracy.\n",
    "* However, this approach was effective only to answer very specific questions (such as identifying the length of incubation periods, etc) and would not be very effective in answering broader questions such as \"What do we know about the relationship between the environment and the virus?\" (unless an article specifically reports that word-for-word of course). \n",
    "* In this approach, most of the Information Retrieval was performed in the TF-IDF step, which converts queries and documents into a simple Bag-of-Words representation. As opposed to current state-of-the-art language models that makes use of attention mechanisms to learn contextual representations, a simple Bag-of-Words representation has poor contextual representation.\n",
    "* For convenience, we used the BERT-finetuned-on-SQuAD model available from Huggingface transformers. This model was pretrained on corpora of texts from Wikipedia and fine-tuned on questions posed on Wikipedia articles (SQuAD). A possible improvement would be to use models that are pre-trained on more relevant domain-specific corpus such as BioBERT or SciBERT (which have been pre-trained on biomedical and scientific publications respectively), and/or further fine-tuning on domain-specific Q&A datasets. One such example could be the PubMedQA Dataset (https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.06146). "
